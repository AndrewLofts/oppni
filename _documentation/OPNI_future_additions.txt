1. Hidden analysis modules (works in progress):

	Discriminant Partial Least Squares (dPLS):  2-class discriminant 
	  analysis assuming isotropic within-class covariance
	
	General Linear Model (GLM): standard ordinary least squares with
	  hrf-convolved design matrix
	
	Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF): measure
	  of BOLD temporal variability in 0.015< x <0.08 Hz band, relative 
	  to total variance

	Reproducible Principal Component Analysis (rPCA): principal components
	  in split-half cross-validation framework

	Hurst exponent (Hurst): estimate of monofractal scaling exponent, 
	  based on detrended fluctuations analysis

	Support vector machines (SVM): 2-class discriminant model, fitted on
	  a linear kernel, with optimization of box constraint

	Global functional connectivity (gConn): measure of average connectivity
	  at each voxel, relative to all others. ** high compute time! **

2. New pipeline options (in branch, need to migrate to trunk):

	Multi-run optimization:  allows user to optimize results in cases 
	  of multiple task runs, if you want to generate a single SPM and
	  pipeline. Now includes compatibility with GLMs too.

	Post-hoc testing:  protocol to automatically submit optimized SPMs into
	  group-level analyses. Includes t-tests, bootstrap estimation and
	  ANOVAs (1-way, 2-way, repeated measures)

	Completely modularized analysis code:  minimized the number of within
	  script dependencies, allowing for the rapid prototyping of new
	  analysis techniques
